# covcomp
This is an R package for implementing the covariance completion algorithm in [1].
The syntax is as follows:
1. For manual choice of truncation parameters used in the algorithm:
```
Compln(Cov, Omega, VectorOfTuning) 
```
Here `VectorIfTuning` is a vector of integers which serve as truncation parameters in the matrix multiplication involved. Naturally, the length of this vector should be at least $m-1$ when we are dealing with an m-serrated domain 立.
2. For automatic choice of truncation parameters in accordance with the fraction of variance explained (FVE) criterion:
```
ComplnFVE(Cov, Omega, FVE) 
```
Here `Cov` is a discretization of the partial covariance K_{立} and `Omega` is a matrix of 1s and 0s which describes the domain 立 of K_{立}.
